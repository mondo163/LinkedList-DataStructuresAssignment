# Linked List - Data Structures Assignment

# Description
This was the linked list assignment from my data structures courses. It implements a double linked list that is being used
to store weather data and keep it organized. Aside from it being a double linked list, it is three-chained meaning it has three different
link chains that connect the wind, temperature, and timespan seperately and keeps the data ordered from smallest to largest. 
Our professor gave us only a starting file and the criteria needed for the assignment to pass.

# Starter File Given
weatherlog.cpp

# Passing Criteria
- Apply a single or double linked list
- Each node with will contain the weather data and three chains for each of the data types
- Each chain in the list will be in order from smallest to largest
- The linked list must have a copy constructor that copies the data correctly
- Removing and inserting nodes must rearrange the three chains correctly keeping data still ordered from smallest to largest
- Linked list will have methods to clean the data and remove duplicates
